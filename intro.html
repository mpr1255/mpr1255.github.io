<h2> Work: </h2>
I am a doctoral candidate in political science at the <a href = "www.anu.edu.au">Australian National University</a>, a consulting data engineer at the <a href="https://victimsofcommunism.org/">Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation</a> where I am involved in <a href="https://www.xinjiangpolicefiles.org/">Xinjiang-related</a> work and database development, and an incoming postdoctoral fellow at the Social Data Science lab at the University of Mannheim, Germany. My PhD thesis explores how states exploit the bodily resources of their subjects, taking as a case <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ajt.16969">organ trafficking</a> in the People's Republic of China. Other work I'm involved in looks at political violence, the death penalty, rule of law in China, PRC policies in Xinjiang, and metascience. These various interests have led me to become something of a digital archivist, and I now maintain a number of large collections of PRC primary source materials, including court decisions, Party documents, and media and academic works. I also maintain a large full text database of <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.240313">social science papers</a>. I primarily use computational and quantitative methods but I am also very interested in theory.
<p>
I've previously worked as a legal researcher, human rights researcher, and interpreter, translator, and primary researcher doing due diligence for financial companies. My BA (ANU) was in continental philosophy and English literature.

This website <strike>is</strike> was based on <a href= "https://web.archive.org/web/19990508071628/http://reality.sgi.com/boehm/">Hans-J. Boehm's</a>. I find the style appropriate and it brings back my earliest memories of the internet.
