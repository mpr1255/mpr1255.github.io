<h2> Work: </h2>
I started at SGI in April 1996.  I'm currently in the Java group.
I'm also still spending some of my time working on
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990508071628/http://www.sgi.com/Technology/STL">STL</a> extensions
with Matt Austern and Alex Stepanov.
<p>
Before that, I was at Xerox PARC, where I worked on
<a href="gc.html">garbage collection</a>,
among other things.  This work was started at Rice University, where it
grew out of work on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990508071628/ftp://parcftp.xerox.com/pub/russell/">
implementation</a> of the Russell programming language.  It is being continued
at a reduced level at SGI.
<p>
Prior to my stay at Rice,
I was an undergraduate at the University of Washington, a grad student
at Cornell University, and an Assistant Professor at the University of
Washington.
<p>
Along the way I've also worked on various other subjects, including
constructive real arithmetic, parallel attribute evaluation, decidability
of type inference, and
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990508071628/http://www.acm.org/pubs/toc/Abstracts/1057-4514/176479.html">
implementation of monitor locks without hardware support</a>.
