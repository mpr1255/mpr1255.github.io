<h2> Work: </h2>
I am a doctoral candidate in political science at the <a href = "www.anu.edu.au">Australian National University</a>. I also do data science for the <a href="https://victimsofcommunism.org/">Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation</a> based in Washington, DC, where I am involved in <a href="https://www.xinjiangpolicefiles.org/">Xinjiang-related</a> research. My work focuses on technology-enabled authoritarian state predation and political violence, with a focus on <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ajt.16969">organ trafficking</a>. I primarily use computational methods but I am also very interested in theory.
<p>
I've previously worked as a human rights researcher and an interpreter and translator for financial companies.
<p>
A list of papers I've been involved in is <a href="pubs.html">here</a>.

This website is based on <a href= "https://web.archive.org/web/19990508071628/http://reality.sgi.com/boehm/">Hans-J. Boehm's</a>. I find the style quite beautiful and it brings back my earliest memories of the internet.
